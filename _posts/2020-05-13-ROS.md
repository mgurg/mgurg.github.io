# ROS

A *node* is a process that performs computation. 

The *ROS Master* provides naming and registration services to the rest of the [nodes](http://wiki.ros.org/Nodes) in the ROS system. It tracks publishers and subscribers to [topics](http://wiki.ros.org/Topics) as well as [services](http://wiki.ros.org/Services). The role of the Master is to enable individual ROS nodes to locate one  another. Once these nodes have located each other they communicate with  each other peer-to-peer. 

Topics are [named](http://wiki.ros.org/Names) buses over which [nodes](http://wiki.ros.org/Nodes) exchange [messages](http://wiki.ros.org/Messages).
