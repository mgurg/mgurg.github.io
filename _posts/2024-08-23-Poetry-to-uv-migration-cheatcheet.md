Package with options (like: `fastapi[standard]`)
```bash
uv add fastapi --extra standard
```

uv is now capable of installing and managing Python itself, making it entirely self-bootstrapping:
```bash
uv python install 3.12
```

To create a virtual environment:    

```bash
uv venv
```

`pyproject.toml` - for small, flat projects where You don't need src folder:
```
[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = ["."]
```

Remember to replace [name], [package], [command], [version], [setting], and [value] with your specific project name, package name, command, version number, setting, and value respectively.
